			Ass Intro," a cut from Chicago rhymer Chance the Rapper's
			forthcoming Acid Rap, sounds like a star-maker, a reputation
			-cementer; "good-ass" just isn't the half of it. The track,
			produced by Stefan Ponce and Peter Cottontale with a vocal
			assist from BJ the Chicago Kid, slides effortlessly from loose,
			gospelly chords to the unmistakable clatter of footwork, like
			a Busby Berkley routine you can juke to. A lesser rapper might
			get lost in the fracas, but Chance easily outshines it all. You'll
			find traces of million-mixtape-era Wayne and Danny Brown's
			recent run in Chance's croaky delivery and rapid-fire flow, but
			what the three really share is the joy they seem to get out of
			rapping. Chance just dances across the track, rapping so hard
			by the end of his first verse, you'll half expect to hear the thud
			as he passes out on the studio floor. "Raps just make me
			anxious, and acid made me crazy," he says at the top of the track,
			and it's that very combination of nervy energy and bugged-out
			wildness that makes "Intro" so very good-ass.</p>
